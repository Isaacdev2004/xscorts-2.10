ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION:
------------------------

Open your web browser and go to:

  → User Site:    http://localhost:8081
  → Admin Panel:  http://localhost:8082

If the pages don't load immediately, wait 30-60 seconds
for the application to finish compiling and starting.

================================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

1. Keep all 3 application windows open (don't close them)
   - API Backend window
   - User Frontend window  
   - Admin Frontend window

2. If you see errors in the windows:
   - Check if MongoDB and Redis are still running
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Try restarting the services

3. To stop the application:
   - Close the 3 application windows
   - Or press Ctrl+C in each window

4. To start again later:
   - Double-click: START-ALL.bat
   - Or use: START-EVERYTHING.bat

================================================================================

DATABASE SETUP (First Time Only):
---------------------------------

If this is your first time running the application,
you may need to run database migrations:

1. Open a new PowerShell/CMD window
2. Navigate to: cd xscorts-2.1.0\api
3. Run: npm run migrate

This will create the admin user:
  - Email: admin@localhost
  - Username: admin
  - Password: (check migration scripts or set during first login)

ENJOY YOUR APPLICATION!
