================================================================================
                    ✅ APPLICATION IS STARTING!
================================================================================

ALL SERVICES HAVE BEEN STARTED:
--------------------------------

✓ API Backend: Starting on port 8080
✓ User Frontend: Starting on port 8081
✓ Admin Frontend: Starting on port 8082

Three command windows have opened. Keep them open!

================================================================================

WHAT TO DO NOW:
---------------

1. WAIT 30-60 SECONDS
   The application is compiling and starting.
   First startup takes longer.

2. CHECK THE WINDOWS
   Look for messages like:
   - "listening on port 8080" (API)
   - "ready on http://localhost:8081" (User)
   - "ready on http://localhost:8082" (Admin)

3. OPEN YOUR BROWSER
   After waiting, try:
   
   → User Site:    http://localhost:8081
   → Admin Panel:  http://localhost:8082

4. IF IT DOESN'T WORK
   - Wait a bit longer (compilation takes time)
   - Check the windows for error messages
   - Make sure MongoDB is running
   - Make sure Redis is running

================================================================================

QUICK STATUS CHECK:
-------------------

To check if services are running, open PowerShell and run:

Test-NetConnection localhost -Port 8080
Test-NetConnection localhost -Port 8081
Test-NetConnection localhost -Port 8082

If "TcpTestSucceeded : True" = Service is running! ✓

================================================================================

FIRST TIME SETUP (If needed):
------------------------------

If this is your first time, you may need to run database migrations:

1. Open a new PowerShell window
2. cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\xscorts-2.1.0\xscorts-2.1.0\api
3. npm run migrate

This creates the admin user:
  - Email: admin@localhost
  - Username: admin

================================================================================

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
-------------------

✓ All 3 windows are open
✓ No error messages in the windows
✓ Browser can access http://localhost:8081
✓ Browser can access http://localhost:8082

================================================================================

The application is starting now. Just wait and then try the URLs!
